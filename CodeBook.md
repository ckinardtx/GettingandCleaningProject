Step 1: "Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set." <br>

Step 3: "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set." <br>

Step 4: "Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names." <br>

Step 5: "Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject." <br> <br>
